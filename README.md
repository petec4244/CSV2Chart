# CSV2Chart
Looking at too many large csv spreadsheets makes my head hurt and increases desire to die.

This simple app will display a csv file with a customizable predefined set of rules, so you only have to look at the data you actually care about. 

Best of all no VBscript Macros!

Another feature of this app, because of the data I use it with it will automatically convert a [Tab] deliminated <.txt> file into a CSV file.
